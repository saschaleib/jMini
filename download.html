			<p>This page is powered by jMini ... though at the present time, there are still some functions that are missing, and they have to be imported from jQuery instead. The long-term plan is to replace them with own functions.</p>
			<p>For more information on jMini, please see <a href="https://github.com/saschaleib/jMini" target="_blank">the GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
